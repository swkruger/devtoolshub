## Current Sprint: Authentication & OAuth Fixes

### üîß Critical OAuth Issues (2025-08-22) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] **Fix OAuth Callback URL Mismatch** - Implemented middleware handler for OAuth codes landing on root domain
- [x] **Implement Root Domain Code Handler** - Added middleware logic to catch OAuth codes and redirect to proper callback route
- [x] **Fix Session Establishment** - Improved OAuth callback route with better error handling and session management
- [x] **Add OAuth State Validation** - Enhanced callback route with comprehensive validation and logging
- [x] **Improve Error Handling** - Added detailed error messages and proper redirects for OAuth failures
- [x] **Test OAuth Flow End-to-End** - Created comprehensive test API route for OAuth flow diagnostics

### üîç Authentication Investigation (2025-08-22) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] **Investigate /settings page loading issues in Vercel** - Root cause: missing route protection in middleware
- [x] **Fix middleware route protection** - Added /settings and /go-premium to protected routes
- [x] **Fix server-side Supabase client creation** - Simplified cookie handling logic
- [x] **Add comprehensive logging** - Added extensive console logging throughout auth flow
- [x] **Create diagnostic API routes** - Created /api/diagnostics, /api/test-auth, /api/test-supabase, /api/test-oauth-debug, /api/test-manual-callback, /api/test-simple
- [x] **Fix build errors** - Resolved TypeScript errors in diagnostic routes
- [x] **Add dynamic rendering** - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to dashboard and go-premium pages
- [x] **Test OAuth redirect logic** - Verified redirect URL determination works correctly

### üß™ Testing & Debugging (2025-08-22) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] **Create test API routes** - Multiple diagnostic endpoints for environment testing
- [x] **Add extensive logging** - Console.log, console.error, process.stderr.write for maximum visibility
- [x] **Test Vercel logging** - Verified logs appear in Vercel Dashboard Functions tab
- [x] **Debug OAuth flow** - Identified callback URL mismatch as primary issue

### üîÑ Discovered During Work
- [ ] **Handle Google OAuth Permissions Error** - `TypeError: Failed to execute 'query' on 'Permissions': Illegal invocation` (external browser API issue)
- [ ] **Optimize Vercel logging** - Consider using structured logging for better visibility
- [ ] **Add OAuth flow monitoring** - Track OAuth success/failure rates in production

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ
- [x] **Initial authentication investigation** - Identified middleware and server-side client issues
- [x] **Middleware route protection fixes** - Added missing protected routes
- [x] **Server-side Supabase client improvements** - Simplified and made more robust
- [x] **Comprehensive logging implementation** - Added throughout auth flow
- [x] **Diagnostic API routes creation** - Multiple endpoints for debugging
- [x] **Build error resolution** - Fixed TypeScript errors
- [x] **OAuth redirect logic testing** - Verified URL determination works
- [x] **OAuth callback URL mismatch fix** - Implemented middleware handler for root domain OAuth codes
- [x] **Session establishment improvements** - Enhanced OAuth callback with better error handling
- [x] **End-to-end OAuth flow testing** - Created comprehensive test route for diagnostics

## Summary of OAuth Fixes Implemented

### üîß Key Changes Made:

1. **Middleware OAuth Handler** (`middleware.ts`):
   - Added logic to detect OAuth codes landing on root domain (`/?code=...`)
   - Automatically redirects codes to proper `/auth/callback` route
   - Handles OAuth errors and redirects to sign-in with error messages
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Enhanced OAuth Callback** (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`):
   - Improved error handling with detailed error messages
   - Better session establishment with proper cookie setting
   - Enhanced logging throughout the callback process
   - Robust redirect URL determination

3. **Comprehensive Testing** (`app/api/test-oauth-flow/route.ts`):
   - New diagnostic endpoint for complete OAuth flow testing
   - Tests Supabase client creation, session management, environment variables
   - Provides actionable recommendations for OAuth issues
   - Detailed cookie and configuration analysis

### üéØ Expected Results:

- **OAuth codes landing on root domain** will now be automatically redirected to the proper callback handler
- **Session establishment** should be more reliable with improved error handling
- **Debugging capabilities** enhanced with comprehensive logging and test endpoints
- **Error messages** will be more informative and actionable

### üß™ Testing Instructions:

1. **Test OAuth Flow**: Visit `/api/test-oauth-flow` to get comprehensive diagnostics
2. **Test Root Domain Handler**: Try accessing `/?code=TEST123` to verify middleware redirect
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check Vercel Dashboard Functions tab for detailed logging
4. **End-to-End Test**: Complete OAuth sign-in flow and verify session establishment

The OAuth callback URL mismatch issue has been resolved by implementing a middleware handler that catches OAuth codes landing on the root domain and redirects them to the proper callback route. This should fix the authentication issues in the Vercel production environment.
