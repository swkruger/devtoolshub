## 🎯 **New Sprint: Authentication Flow Investigation** (2025-01-27)

### 🎯 **Phase 1: Authentication Flow Analysis** - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] **Review authentication middleware** - Analyzed middleware.ts for potential redirect issues
- [x] **Check OAuth callback handling** - Investigated auth/callback route for proper user creation
- [x] **Examine user profile creation** - Reviewed automatic profile creation after OAuth sign-in
- [x] **Analyze session management** - Checked session handling and persistence
- [x] **Review redirect logic** - Investigated post-authentication redirect behavior

### **Phase 1 Findings:**
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: The `handle_new_user()` database trigger function was incorrectly redefined in the RLS migration
- ✅ **Issue**: The trigger function was not actually inserting user records into the `users` table
- ✅ **Impact**: New users could authenticate with OAuth but had no profile in the database
- ✅ **Solution**: Created migration to fix the trigger function and added fallback profile creation

### 🎯 **Phase 2: Database & User Creation** - IN PROGRESS 🔄
- [x] **Check user table structure** - Verified user table schema and constraints
- [x] **Review RLS policies** - Analyzed Row Level Security policies for new users
- [ ] **Apply database migration** - Run the fix for the user creation trigger
- [ ] **Test user creation flow** - Verify automatic profile creation works correctly
- [ ] **Check for database errors** - Look for any database-related issues in logs

### **Phase 2 Actions:**
- ✅ **Migration Created**: `028_fix_user_creation_trigger.sql` - Fixes the broken trigger function
- ✅ **Rollback Created**: `028_rollback_fix_user_creation_trigger.sql` - For safe rollback if needed
- ✅ **Fallback Logic Added**: OAuth callback and useUser hook now create profiles if trigger fails
- 🔄 **Next Step**: Apply the migration to fix the database trigger

### 🎯 **Phase 3: Environment & Configuration** - PENDING ⏳
- [ ] **Verify OAuth configuration** - Check Google/GitHub OAuth settings in Supabase
- [ ] **Review environment variables** - Ensure all auth-related env vars are properly set
- [ ] **Check redirect URLs** - Verify OAuth redirect URLs are correctly configured
- [ ] **Test OAuth providers** - Verify OAuth providers are working correctly

### 🎯 **Phase 4: Client-Side Authentication** - PENDING ⏳
- [ ] **Review auth hooks** - Check useUser and authentication hooks
- [ ] **Analyze sign-in components** - Review sign-in forms and modals
- [ ] **Check session tracking** - Review SessionTracker component
- [ ] **Test authentication state** - Verify auth state management

### 🎯 **Phase 5: Testing & Debugging** - PENDING ⏳
- [ ] **Create test scenarios** - Set up test cases for new user sign-in flow
- [ ] **Add debugging logs** - Add comprehensive logging for authentication flow
- [ ] **Test edge cases** - Test various OAuth scenarios and error conditions
- [ ] **Verify fixes** - Test proposed solutions and verify they work

### **Task Details:**
- **Issue**: New users cannot sign in - redirected to home page after OAuth
- **Symptoms**: No errors in logs or browser console, but users not properly authenticated
- **Goal**: Identify and fix the root cause of authentication failure for new users
- **Approach**: Systematic investigation of the entire authentication flow

### **Investigation Areas:**
1. **Middleware Redirect Logic**: Check if middleware is properly handling new users
2. **OAuth Callback Processing**: Verify callback route creates user profiles correctly
3. **Database User Creation**: Ensure new users are properly inserted into database
4. **Session Management**: Check if sessions are being created and maintained
5. **Environment Configuration**: Verify OAuth providers and redirect URLs
6. **Client-Side State**: Check authentication state management in React components
