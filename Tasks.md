🧱 **Phase 1: Project Template & Core Architecture** ✅ **COMPLETE**
Goal: Build the foundational framework, UI system, auth, layout, routing, and Supabase integration.

## 🔧 Setup & Structure
✅ As a developer, I want the project bootstrapped using Next.js App Router with TypeScript, so I have a modern foundation.

✅ As a developer, I want Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI installed and configured, so I can rapidly build beautiful UIs.

✅ As a developer, I want a base layout with a responsive sidebar and top navigation, so I can scaffold the user interface easily.

✅ As a developer, I want the project to support modular tool pages under /tools/[tool-name], so I can add tools independently.

✅ As a developer, I want shared UI components in components/ui/, so styling and behavior are consistent.

## 🔐 Supabase Auth & User Management
✅ As a user, I want to sign in with Google using Supabase OAuth, so I can access tools securely.

✅ As a user, I want to sign in with GitHub using Supabase OAuth, so I have an alternative login option.

✅ As a user, I want to see a "Sign In" button if not authenticated, so I know where to log in.

✅ As a user, I want to see my name and avatar in the top nav when logged in, so I know I'm authenticated.

✅ As a developer, I want authenticated routes protected via Supabase middleware, so unauthenticated users cannot access tool pages.

✅ As a user, I want my profile stored in Supabase (user ID, email, name, avatar, plan), so the app can manage free vs. premium access.

## 💳 User Plans (Free vs Premium)
✅ As a user, I want a default "free" plan assigned on signup, so I can access basic tools right away.

✅ As a developer, I want a user record in Supabase to include a plan column (free, premium), so I can restrict access to premium features.

✅ As a developer, I want to add RLS (Row Level Security) to prevent unauthorized premium access.

✅ As a user, I want to access all tools for free, so I can use basic functionality without upgrading.

---

🧩 **Phase 2: Tool Module Framework**
Goal: Enable scalable plugin-style tool pages with shared layout, metadata config, and access control.

✅ As a developer, I want each tool to live under /tools/[tool-name] with its own folder and config, so tools are easily maintainable.

⬜ As a user, I want to see a tool's title, description, and icon in a consistent header, so the UI feels cohesive.

✅ As a user, I want to see a searchable list of available tools on the dashboard, so I can find what I need.

✅ As a developer, I want to mark tools as free or premium features in their config file, so the UI can control feature access.

⬜ As a user, I want to see premium feature prompts within tools when I try to use advanced functionality.

---

🛠 **Phase 3: First Batch of Tool Modules**
Goal: Build core tools, each with free and premium functionality.

## 📄 JSON Formatter
⬜ As a user, I want to paste JSON and see it formatted with syntax highlighting (free), so I can debug quickly.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to download formatted JSON as a file, so I can save and share results.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to validate large (5MB+) JSON files, so I'm not limited by size.

## 🔍 RegEx Tester
⬜ As a user, I want to test a regular expression against a text input (free), so I can see matches live.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to get match group highlighting and error explanation, so I better understand my pattern.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to save and reuse regex patterns in my account.

## 🔐 JWT Decoder
⬜ As a user, I want to paste a JWT and decode its payload (free), so I can see token content.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to verify the token's signature with a public key, so I can validate secure JWTs.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to upload or store secret keys securely in my account.

## 📸 Image Compressor
✅ As a user, I want to upload and compress one image (free), so I can reduce its file size.

✅ As a premium user, I want to batch upload and compress multiple images at once.

✅ As a premium user, I want to convert image formats (JPEG → WebP, PNG → AVIF).
