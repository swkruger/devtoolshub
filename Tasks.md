# DevToolsHub - Project Tasks

🧱 **Phase 1: Project Template & Core Architecture**
Goal: Build the foundational framework, UI system, auth, layout, routing, and Supabase integration.

## 🔧 Setup & Structure
✅ As a developer, I want the project bootstrapped using Next.js App Router with TypeScript, so I have a modern foundation.

✅ As a developer, I want Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI installed and configured, so I can rapidly build beautiful UIs.

✅ As a developer, I want a base layout with a responsive sidebar and top navigation, so I can scaffold the user interface easily.

✅ As a developer, I want the project to support modular tool pages under /tools/[tool-name], so I can add tools independently.

✅ As a developer, I want shared UI components in components/ui/, so styling and behavior are consistent.

## 🔐 Supabase Auth & User Management
✅ As a user, I want to sign in with Google using Supabase OAuth, so I can access tools securely.

✅ As a user, I want to sign in with GitHub using Supabase OAuth, so I have an alternative login option.

✅ As a user, I want to see a "Sign In" button if not authenticated, so I know where to log in.

✅ As a user, I want to see my name and avatar in the top nav when logged in, so I know I'm authenticated.

✅ As a developer, I want authenticated routes protected via Supabase middleware, so unauthenticated users cannot access tool pages.

✅ As a user, I want my profile stored in Supabase (user ID, email, name, avatar, plan), so the app can manage free vs. premium access.

## 💳 User Plans (Free vs Premium)
✅ As a user, I want a default "free" plan assigned on signup, so I can access basic tools right away.

✅ As a developer, I want a user record in Supabase to include a plan column (free, premium), so I can restrict access to premium features.

✅ As a developer, I want to add RLS (Row Level Security) to prevent unauthorized premium access.

✅ As a user, I want to access all tools for free, so I can use basic functionality without upgrading.

---

🧩 **Phase 2: Tool Module Framework**
Goal: Enable scalable plugin-style tool pages with shared layout, metadata config, and access control.

✅ As a developer, I want each tool to live under /tools/[tool-name] with its own folder and config, so tools are easily maintainable.

⬜ As a user, I want to see a tool's title, description, and icon in a consistent header, so the UI feels cohesive.

✅ As a user, I want to see a searchable list of available tools on the dashboard, so I can find what I need.

✅ As a developer, I want to mark tools as free or premium features in their config file, so the UI can control feature access.

⬜ As a user, I want to see premium feature prompts within tools when I try to use advanced functionality.

---

⬜ As a premium user, I want to batch upload and compress multiple images at once.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to convert image formats (JPEG → WebP, PNG → AVIF).

## 🧬 UUID Generator
⬜ As a user, I want to generate UUID v4s on the fly (free), so I can use them in my code.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to generate bulk UUIDs and export them.

Goal: Smooth, beautiful app experience with saved state, user preferences, and help.

⬜ As a user, I want dark mode toggle and theme persistence (localStorage), so the UI fits my preference.

⬜ As a premium user, I want to save tool inputs (e.g. last JSON/Regex) per tool.

⬜ As a user, I want to favorite/star tools for quick access.

⬜ As a user, I want in-app documentation/help in each tool, so I can learn how to use it.
