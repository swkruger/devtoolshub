<p>The planner renders a synchronized timeline for all selected cities. A shared time scrubber moves every card in unison, accurately handling DST transitions and historical offsets. Business‑hour shading and weekend cues make it obvious when a slot is workable.</p>
<p>The meeting finder scores candidate windows using overlap and local business‑hour heuristics. You can nudge the duration, adjust constraints, and copy or export the final slot in seconds. Weather overlays (premium) provide useful context for travel or outdoor events.</p>
