<p><strong>World Clock &amp; Time Zones</strong> is built for remote teams, SREs, and analysts who coordinate across continents. Compare cities side‑by‑side, scrub time forward or backward, and instantly see who is in business hours, evening, or off‑hours.</p>
<p>Instead of a dense table, the tool uses clear, card‑based tiles so each city keeps its context (name, country, offset, and optional weather). Reorder cards, pin favorites, and preview how a proposed meeting time looks for everyone before you send a calendar invite.</p>
<p>Premium users unlock unlimited cities, live weather, advanced date ranges (±30 days), and one‑click calendar export—perfect for recurring cross‑region coordination.</p>
